# Telegram Language Tutor Bot

A simple multilingual Telegram bot that helps you expand your vocabulary, learn new phrases, and improve pronunciation.

The bot supports any combination of native and learning languages.  
Just send a word or sentence to the Telegram chat where your bot is added ‚Äî it will automatically translate it and send back an audio message with the pronunciation.

The audio message includes:

```
<the phrase in studying language>, 
<the phrase in your native language>, 
<the slow phrase in studying language>
```

### Audio Example

Audio example for English (studying language) and French (native language), generated by the bot:

<audio controls>
  <source src="examples/beautiful_city_fr.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  _Audio element is not supported here._
</audio>

[Download MP3](examples/beautiful_city_fr.mp3)

If you send a single word and the translation module provides definitions or examples, those will also be included in the audio file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vensder/language-tutor-bot.git
cd language-tutor-bot
```
### Set up a virtual environment

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure your environment

Copy the example `.env` file and replace the placeholder token with your real Telegram Bot API token:

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```

Or you can export it manually in your terminal:

```sh
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOabcdefghijklmnopqrst
```

If you don‚Äôt have a Telegram bot yet, create one using BotFather and get your token:

Create your bot with BotFather: https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather

Authorize your bot: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#authorizing-your-bot

### Configure your languages

Edit the configuration file and set your native language and learning language codes.
You can find all available language codes here:

### Run the bot

```sh
./main.py
```

### üéß Why It‚Äôs Useful

The bot saves audio files directly in your Telegram group or channel, so you can:

- Listen to them anytime on your phone (even while walking)
- Play them in sequence using the Telegram media player
- Delete the ones you‚Äôve already memorized and add new ones easily

## üê≥ Run with Docker Compose

You can easily build and run the bot using Docker Compose.

### Set up your environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can copy from `.env.example`) and update it with your real Telegram bot token and language codes:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Example .env:

```sh
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOabcdefghijklmnopqrst
LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
LEARNING_LANGUAGE=en
NATIVE_LANGUAGE=fr
```

### Build the Docker image

```sh
docker compose build
```

### Start the bot

Run the bot in the background:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

To check the logs:

```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

### Stop the bot

When you‚Äôre done, stop and remove the container:

```sh
docker compose down
```

This setup keeps your environment clean and allows you to run the bot anywhere with a single command.
